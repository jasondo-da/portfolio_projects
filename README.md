## A/B Test Project

Code: [A/B Test Project](https://github.com/jasondo-da/portfolio_projects/blob/main/abtest_project_pdf.pdf)

Goal: To compile a list of hypotheses that may help boost revenue, initiate an A/B test, and analyze the results. 

Description: This project is focused on two parts: analyzing a list of potential hypotheses and initiating an A/B test to find the hypothesis that can best help boost company revenue. The first dataset includes various hypotheses and their rating in reach, impact, confidence, and effort. The second dataset includes transaction IDs, visitor IDs, revenue accumulated, and other relevant information. Completing this project includes pre-processing data, calculating both ICE and RICE rating methods, A/B testing, and creating visuals of the results.  

Skills: data cleaning, data analysis, correlation matrices, hypothesis testing, A/B testing, data visualization

Technology: VS Code, Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib

## AtliQ Hardware Customer Analysis

Code: [AtliQ Hardware Customer Analysis](https://github.com/jasondo-da/portfolio_projects/blob/main/atliq_customer_analysis_pdf.pdf)

Goal: To conduct a customer analysis for AtliQ Hardware with the goal of increasing their customer orders and growing their customer base.

Description: As a junior analyst for a third-party consulting agency, our client AtliQ Hardware is interested in learning more about their customers and is asking for a customer analysis. AtliQ Hardware has provided us with a backup of their database in the SQLite format. AtliQ Hardware has also restricted the ability to load the whole database to CSV. The backup database includes data on customers, products, gross prices, monthly sales, and other relevant information. Completing this project includes connecting to the database, cleaning data, pre-processing data, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and creating visuals for the discovered results.

Skills: SQL querying, data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data visualization

Technology: VS Code, Pandas, SQLite3, Matplotlib

## Secondary Market Automobile Sales Analysis 

Code: [Secondary Market Automobile Sales Analysis](https://github.com/jasondo-da/portfolio_projects/blob/main/car_web_app_pdf.pdf)

[Web Application](https://car-ad-project.onrender.com/)

Goal: Building and maintaining various Python environments, creating a web application, and uploading it to a cloud service provider to make it accessible to those who want to use it.

Description: This project is to provide a dataset record of car sales. These records include the price of sale, model, model year, condition, odometer, manufacturer, and other important information about vehicle sales. To complete this project, requires data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data visualization, and knowledge of how to use GitHub and render to build the web application.

Skills: data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data visualization

Technology: VS Code, Pandas, Streamlit, Plotly, Vega-Altair, GitHub, render

## Instacart Exploratory Data Analysis

Code: [Instacart Exploratory Data Analysis](https://github.com/jasondo-da/portfolio_projects/blob/main/insta_cart_pdf.pdf)

Goal: To clean the data and prepare a report that gives insight into the behavior and shopping habits of Instacart customers from 2017.

Description: Using a modified version of Instacart 2017 data, this project is a test to see if we can clean all the errors and process the data of the modified Instacart data. The database includes Instacart orders, products, departments, and other important information. To complete this project will require high attention to detail during the cleaning and pre-processing segment of the project and a deep understanding of the data to accurately report customer behavior through easy-to-read visuals.

Skills: data cleaning, data analysis, data visualization

Technology: VS Code, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib

## Megaline Mobile Carrier Machine Learning Model 

Code: [Megaline Mobile Carrier Machine Learning Model](https://github.com/jasondo-da/portfolio_projects/blob/main/megaline_project_pdf.pdf)

Goal: The project goal is to develop a model with the highest possible accuracy for our client Megaline a popular mobile carrier. For this project, our client is expecting an accuracy threshold of at least 0.75.

Description: Megaline wants to develop a model that would analyze subscribers' behavior and recommend one of Megaline's newer plans: Smart or Ultra. Megaline gave permission to access the behavioral database about subscribers who have already switched to the new plans. This database includes calls, minutes called, messages sent, and other important information. To complete our goals, we developed a model with the highest possible accuracy. To do that we are going to split the sample data into a training set, a validation set, and a test set and input these data sets into various models to find the model with the highest accuracy score.

Skills: processing data sets, defining functions, data visualization

Technology: VS Code, Pandas, scikit-learn, Matplotlib

## Yandex.Afisha Marketing Expense Analysis

Code: [Yandex.Afisha Marketing Expense Analysis](https://github.com/jasondo-da/portfolio_projects/blob/main/yandex_afisha_pdf.pdf)

Goal: Analyze the marketing expenses for Yandex.Afisha and find methods to optimize it.

Description: As an intern for Yandex.Afisha our first task is to help optimize the marketing expenses. Yandex.Afisha will allow access to server logs for the visits from June 2017 through May 2018, a large file of all the orders, and marketing expense statistics. The project involves data cleaning, data analysis, business analysis, cohort analysis, and data visualization.

Skills: data cleaning, business analysis, cohort analysis, data visualization

Technology: VS Code, Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib
